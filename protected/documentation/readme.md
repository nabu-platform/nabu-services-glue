# Brief Introduction

Glue is a scripting language that uses the same execution engine as Blox. However, where Blox is focused on delivering a visual, simplified interface, Glue focuses on power features, allowing you to get things done quickly.

The service oriented Nabu environment fits really well into the functional Glue environment, where each service is automatically exposed as a function. The Nabu type system is seamlessly integrated, and the query engine that powers both Blox and Glue really comes into its own with Glue's addition of lambda's.

- pre/post processing of http requests
- loading the environment for page builder
- rule evaluation in signals
- system automation
- ...
